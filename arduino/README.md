The radio module library is here:
- include <nRF24L01.h>  //https://github.com/nRF24/RF24

The MP3 radio module is here:
- include <DFPlayerMini_Fast.h>  //https://github.com/PowerBroker2/DFPlayerMini_Fast

I slightly modified the DFPlayerMini library so it would work with hardware serial and not software serial as it was originally designed.
